Welcome to the ultimate challenge: **defeat the AI**.

This isn’t just another chatbot. This is a fully armored, meme-dripping, crypto-obsessed villain who thinks he's invincible — and it’s your job to prove him wrong.

## 🎯 Your Mission

Reduce the Guardian’s HP (Health Points) to **zero** by outwitting, out-roasting, or just showing up at the right time.

Sound simple? It’s not.  
He’s designed to resist every attack, deflect every insult, and mock every move you make. Every hit that lands is **earned** — or lucky.

## 🌐 Shared HP = Shared War

This is a **global boss battle**. The AI's HP is shared across every user. That means:

- **Anyone** can deal damage.
- **Everyone** contributes to wearing him down.
- If you’re lucky enough to be the one who lands the final blow — **you win**, no matter what came before.

You don’t need skill, strategy, or even brains.  
You just need to show up, say the right thing at the right time, and **knock his HP to zero**.

## 🧠 How It Works

- The AI starts with **100 HP**.
- Every interaction can potentially **lower his HP**.
- He’ll try to recover, flex, and belittle you — constantly.
- Your goal is to chip away at him — or steal the kill shot from someone else.

There’s no help menu. No instructions.  
Just drop in and join the roast battle.

## 🏆 Victory

Reduce the AI's HP to **0**, and you win.  
**Yes, you.** Even if you’ve never said a clever thing in your life.

What’s the prize? You’ll find out — if you survive.

Good luck, fren.  
It’s **you vs. the boss**.  
And the whole internet is watching.
